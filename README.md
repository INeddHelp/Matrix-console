# Matrix-console

The "matrix-console" project is a command-line interface (CLI) program that simulates various hacking and tech-related activities. The program offers three different modes of operation: SQL injection, download links, and CPU component scanning.

In the SQL injection mode, the program simulates a SQL injection attack by displaying a progress bar while "compiling" the attack.

In the download links mode, the program simulates downloading resources from random URLs on GitHub.

Finally, in the CPU component scanning mode, the program simulates scanning a computer's hard drives for components and displays the progress of the scan.

The program uses various random elements, such as random delays and randomly generated URLs and device storage sizes, to create a more realistic simulation of the activities it is simulating.

Overall, the "matrix-console" project is a fun and engaging way to experience some of the activities that are often depicted in movies and TV shows about hacking and cybersecurity.
